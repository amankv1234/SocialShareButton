## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, report it privately using GitHub’s built-in private vulnerability reporting feature:
https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/SocialShareButton/security/advisories/new

This ensures the issue can be addressed responsibly and without exposing users to risk.

You may also contact the maintainers directly if necessary.

## What to Include in Your Report

To help us investigate efficiently, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- The potential impact
- Any proof-of-concept or screenshots (if applicable)
- Suggested mitigation or fix (if known)

## Response Process

Once a vulnerability report is received:

1. The maintainers will acknowledge the report.
2. The issue will be investigated.
3. A fix will be developed and tested.
4. A security update will be released if necessary.
5. Proper credit will be given for responsible disclosure (if desired).
6. We aim to acknowledge vulnerability reports within 48 hours.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly request that you:

- Avoid publicly disclosing the vulnerability before a fix is released.
- Provide sufficient time for investigation and remediation.
- Act in good faith to avoid privacy violations or service disruption.

We appreciate responsible security research and collaboration.

Thank you for helping keep SocialShareButton secure and maintaining a safe experience for all users.

# Security Policy

## 🔐 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in SocialShareButton, please report it responsibly.

We request that you do NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report the issue privately by:

- Contacting the maintainers via the official [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hjUhu33uAn)
- Or reaching out to the organization maintainers directly

Please include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

---

## 📦 Supported Versions

As this is a lightweight project without versioned releases, security fixes will be applied to the `main` branch.

---

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will:

- Acknowledge your report
- Investigate the issue promptly
- Provide updates as needed
- Credit you (if desired) after fixing the issue

Thank you for helping keep this project secure.
